// Intake — minimal-edit transforms (spec 035 §F5, gaps G5/S18). The
// intake must NEVER rewrite a hand-authored doc: augmenting one ADDS the
// new information and leaves the existing prose intact. These are pure string
// transforms over a memory body; the store wiring (read target → augment →
// write, with this as the guard) is a separate increment.
//
// The judge already emits [[wikilinks]] inside the addition, so these transforms
// are link-agnostic — they only own the append + the no-clobber guarantee.

/**
 * Minimal-edit augmentation: weave `addition` into `existing` by APPENDING it as
 * a new paragraph, never rewriting the existing prose. The original content
 * survives verbatim (it remains a prefix of the result) — the no-clobber

 * addition leaves the doc unchanged; an empty doc becomes just the addition.

 * No-clobber backstop (G5, the "git diff is the backstop" check in code): true
 * iff every non-empty line of `before` still appears in `after`. `augmentBody`
 * satisfies it by construction; the apply layer uses it to REJECT any edit that
 * would drop hand-authored content (e.g. a supersede the model over-rewrote).
 *
 * This is a per-line SUBSTRING test, not whole-line membership — so a dropped
 * line whose text coincidentally appears inside a different `after` line passes
 * (a false positive). That's an accepted backstop limitation (spec §F5 leans on
 * layered nets — git revert, the review feed, manual merge — not a perfect
 * proof): it only ever fails to CATCH a clobber, never wrongly rejects a clean
 * edit, and the primary augment path is clobber-free by construction anyway.
