// Whole-vault restore + activity-feed provenance (rethink T21, spec §8 / D16).
//
// The guarded restore sequence, exactly as D16 orders it (the tRPC layer owns
// the typed-confirmation gate before any of this runs):
//
//   1. refuse while a curation/intake run is in flight, and while another
//      restore holds the (process-wide) restore lock;
//   2. pause the curator — both ticks check `isCuratorPausedForRestore`
//      before anything else, run-now included;
//   3. snapshot any uncommitted out-of-band edits, then `git tag
//      pre-restore-<timestamp>` on the current HEAD (the safety anchor);
//   4. make the working tree match the target commit's tree and commit it as
//      ONE new commit ("vault: restore to <hash>") — never a history rewrite;
//   5. invalidate the disposable index/caches; resume the curator.
//
// Resume is in a `finally`: a failure anywhere mid-sequence still resumes the
// curator, and the thrown error says honestly how far the sequence got (the
// safety tag, once created, is named so the operator can find it).
