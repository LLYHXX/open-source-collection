// The typed, shelf-safe audit export (spec 064 T6–T8 / SC 8–12) — the read half of the
// attribution substrate. `LibrarianStore.exportAudit` turns the vault's git history into a
// stream of typed `AuditEvent`s answering "who SUCCESSFULLY changed what, when, on which shelf"
// without a consumer ever parsing git. The honest scope (what this canNOT answer — reads,
// refused writes, no-op mutations) is the published honesty list (§3 / the docs page).
//
// Three things live here:
//   1. The PERMANENT published record — `AuditEvent`, the closed `AuditAction` union, the zod
//      schema, and the `AuditSourceError`/`AuditCursorError` classes (SC 8). `AuditAction` is
//      enumerated in full because the entrypoint is permanent: adding a member later is a MAJOR
//      bump, so it is never a wildcard.
//   2. The pure subject→action / subject→id derivation (one source of truth with the T1 commit
//      vocabulary), and the read-side attribution defence SC 7c: a commit carrying ≠1
//      `Librarian-Actor` trailer exports `actor: null` — a forged/duplicated trailer is never
//      believed, even if the write-side sanitiser were bypassed.
//   3. The per-commit → events engine (`buildAuditEvents`) with the shelf filter (SC 9), the
//      non-ASCII-safe path membership (SC 9b — the read itself pins `core.quotePath=false`),
//      the admin-only `paths`/`renames`/`diff` gate, the promotion (departure/arrival) records
//      (SC 10) and the straddle downgrade to `vault.change`.
