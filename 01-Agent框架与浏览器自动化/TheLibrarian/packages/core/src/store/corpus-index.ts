// Vault → index bridge (plan 036 Phase 3/7 cutover / spec 035 §F2-F4, slimmed
// per the 2026-06-12 rethink D8). Two independent retrieval surfaces over the
// markdown vault:
//   - memories/<id>.md   → the recall index (active only; archived are excluded)
//   - references/**.md   → search_references (raw markdown, retrieved on demand)
//
// recall runs on the plain hybrid index (keyword+vector RRF) + the wikilink
// graph — no namespace wrapper. References are never part of the recall index
// (recall is memories-only by construction, S8); search_references builds its
// own references-only index per call.
//
// This is the disposable index — rebuildable from the vault at any time (the
// reindex / "delete .index/ → rebuild → equivalent hits" contract is just
// calling this again). Recall ids are memory ids (resolve via the store);
// reference ids are vault-relative paths (resolve via vault.readText).
//
// Built against the current memory-doc schema: title + body + tags compose the
// searchable text (like searchMemories; project_key is omitted — this is a
// different retrieval engine). The D16 frontmatter minimisation is a separable
// later cleanup and does not gate this.
