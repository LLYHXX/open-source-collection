/**
 * Sentinel actor ids for the two legacy authenticated-but-UNBOUND request paths
 * (spec 061 §6 — names decided by Jim, 2026-07-12, PERMANENT once written to vaults).
 *
 * These are the resolved {@link Principal.actorId} for credentials that authenticate a
 * request without cryptographically binding it to one agent. Which path produces each:
 *
 *   - `envToken` = `env-token-agent` — the shared env single-token path
 *     (`LIBRARIAN_AGENT_TOKEN`, `auth.ts` `resolveAgent`'s agentId-less match): one token
 *     many agents share, so it names none of them.
 *   - `localhost` = `local-agent` — BOTH the localhost no-auth bypass (`auth.ts`'s
 *     `allowNoAuth` branch, a tokenless local-dev caller) AND the stdio bin invoked with no
 *     agent id (`bin/stdio.ts`), which have the same "trusted-but-anonymous local caller"
 *     shape.
 *
 * Contract (spec 061 SC 1/SC 3), load-bearing:
 *   - They are `agent`-kind sentinels, NOT reserved system ids, so they normalise/classify as
 *     ordinary agents (`actorKind` → `"agent"`).
 *   - They NEVER appear as {@link Principal.boundActorId}: a sentinel is an attribution
 *     fallback, not a credential binding, so it must never masquerade as one — otherwise
 *     {@link resolveCaller}'s impersonation guard would fire for every self-identifying
 *     single-token agent. A body-supplied `agent_id` therefore continues to WIN over the
 *     sentinel (precedence order unchanged: injected > raw body > token-bound), exactly as it
 *     did before — the sentinel is only the fallback when nothing else resolves.
 *   - Where a {@link Principal} exists, they REPLACE the legacy `unknown-agent` fallback as the
 *     no-id attribution actor in persisted frontmatter (via {@link ResolveCallerInput.fallbackActorId}).
 *     This is the ONE deliberate, OSS-visible attribution change in spec 061 (SC 3, ADR 0011's
 *     "unknown-agent ambiguity replaced" consequence — signed off by Jim 2026-07-12); every other
 *     caller keeps `unknown-agent` (no principal, no fallback). Existing vault files are untouched.

/**

 * SC 1). Collapses today's four identity shapes (`AuthResult`, `ToolContext`'s role/agentId
 * pair, the tRPC role, `ResolvedCaller`) behind a single, provider-produced value.
 *
 * The `actorId`/`boundActorId` split is the design's spine:
 *   - `actorId` — ALWAYS present and NON-EMPTY: the resolved actor used for attribution
 *     (frontmatter `agent_id`). For unbound paths it is a fallback/sentinel
 *     ({@link SENTINEL_ACTOR_IDS}). A provider MUST supply a non-empty string — an empty
 *     `actorId` is a contract violation, not a legal "anonymous" value (use a sentinel for
 *     anonymity). The OSS code paths are type- and shape-test-enforced never to yield one (SC 3).
 *   - `boundActorId` — present ONLY when a credential cryptographically binds an identity
 *     (the per-agent token map, DB-minted `lib.<id>.…` tokens). It is what
 *     {@link resolveCaller} receives as its `authenticatedAgentId`, so its impersonation
 *     guard throws when a body-claimed id disagrees with a *binding*. A sentinel/fallback
 *     actor must therefore NEVER surface as `boundActorId` — doing so would make every
 *     self-identifying single-token agent trip that guard.
 *
 * `kind` is an OPEN string union — authorisation reads `roles`, not `kind`, so a plugin
 * introduces `member`/`curator` without an upstream enum edit. `scope`/`tokenId` mirror
 * the mcp-server `AuthResult` fields' types. `attrs` is opaque to OSS (free-form strings
 * for v1, spec 061 §6): a member-aware provider carries `memberId` there; core never reads it.
