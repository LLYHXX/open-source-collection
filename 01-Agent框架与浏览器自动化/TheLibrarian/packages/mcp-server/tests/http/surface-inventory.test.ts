// Surface inventory — the exact route set each listener serves (spec 060 SC 2).
//
// The T1 route-table refactor (spec 060) replaces the per-surface if-ladder in
// http/routes.ts with a declarative table. This suite is its tripwire: it pins
// which paths each listener answers so a route can't silently move between
// surfaces (or a surface start answering a path it must not) without an
// assertion here flipping.
//
//   - PUBLIC  (LIBRARIAN_HOST:PORT)      → /healthz, /primer.md, /mcp,
//                                          /transcript, /ingest ; /trpc/* → 404
//   - INTERNAL(LIBRARIAN_TRPC_HOST:PORT) → /trpc/* only ; everything else → 404
//
// Each probe is UNAUTHENTICATED on purpose: the question is "is this path routed
// on this surface?", answered by 404 (absent) vs the route's own health/auth
// status (present) — NOT by exercising the handler (that is covered by
// routes.test / listeners.test / the per-endpoint suites).
