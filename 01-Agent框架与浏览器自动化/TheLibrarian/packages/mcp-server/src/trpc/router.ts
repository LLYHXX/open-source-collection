// Composes the per-feature routers (memories, handoffs) plus health and
// admin surfaces. The `AppRouter` type is the public contract the
// dashboard imports.
//
// sessions-rethink PR 7 — the `sessions` router is retired with the
// rest of the session subsystem. D16 — the `domains` router is retired
// with the rest of the domain model. The event ledger is gone; the
// vault's git history is the audit trail, surfaced by the `activity`
// router (rethink T21): the commit feed + the guarded whole-vault restore.

/**
 * The core feature routers, keyed by their top-level namespace. Broken out as a
 * named record (rather than inlined into the `router(...)` call) so the plugin
 * layer can compose it: `buildAppRouter` (plugin.ts, spec 060 T4) merges plugin
 * namespaces alongside these to build the runtime tRPC router, and its keys ARE
 * the reserved namespaces a plugin name may not shadow (`assertNoCoreNamespace-
 * Collision`). `appRouter` — and thus the dashboard's `AppRouter` contract — is
 * exactly `router(coreRouterRecord)`, unchanged by that composition.
