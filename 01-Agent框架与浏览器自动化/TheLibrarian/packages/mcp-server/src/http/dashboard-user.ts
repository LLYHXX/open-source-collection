// The dashboard→server IDENTITY ASSERTION contract (spec 065 SC 1 / SC 11).
//
// The dashboard process is TRUSTED on the internal tRPC listener (admin with no bearer,
// ADR 0008 P3). This header is NOT a credential — it is a scoping ASSERTION the trusted
// process makes about WHO a request is on behalf of: a signed-in user, or explicitly
// *nobody*. It only ever NARROWS what a request may do (a privilege drop, like `sudo -u`).
// The OSS default provider IGNORES it (byte-identical admin-by-isolation, SC 4); a
// member-aware provider maps the assertion to a member principal by SC 9's table.
//
// This module is the SERVER-SIDE reader half of the contract. The dashboard is the setter
// (its own base64url encoder, matched byte-for-byte by Node's `base64url` decode below);
// `readDashboardUser` is the ONLY thing that interprets the header, and it is the security
// boundary: everything that is not POSITIVELY one of the two SC 1 shapes is `invalid`, so
// the unclassified remainder can never drift toward `absent` (SC 11). Absence and badness are
// DIFFERENT outcomes because SC 9 routes them to OPPOSITE trust results — a helper that
// collapsed both to `null` would let an oversize or corrupt assertion resolve to admin (spec
// §7 pass 1). Hence the four-way {@link DashboardAssertion}, never a nullable.
