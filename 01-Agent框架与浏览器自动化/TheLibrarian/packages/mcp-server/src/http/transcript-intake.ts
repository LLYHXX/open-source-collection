// Transcript-intake: the harness-agnostic capture door (spec
// 2026-06-16-harness-auto-capture, T1; SC5, SC6, SC11).
//
// This is the server-side half of automatic capture's *ingestion* clock
// (spec §4.2/§4.3): a per-turn delta from any harness adapter lands here,
// is redacted, and is appended forward-only to a per-conversation sidecar
// buffer. The *extraction* clock (settle-sweep → curator) is T2 and reads
// the buffer this writes — it is deliberately NOT here.
//
// Contract design (spec SC11 "uniform contract"): the payload is
// harness-agnostic — the Claude adapter is the first consumer, but a Pi /
// Hermes / mock adapter validates against this same shape. Validation is
// strict + teaching (AGENTS.md "errors teach"); a malformed body is a 400,
// never a thrown 500.
//
// Privacy invariants (AGENTS.md "privacy is the product", spec §4.5):
//   - REDACT ON INTAKE, BEFORE the disk write. redactSecrets runs over each
//     turn's text and the REDACTED text is what's appended — no raw secret
//     ever reaches the sidecar (SC5).
//   - The buffer lives OUTSIDE the git vault, at `<data-dir>/transcripts/`,
//     sibling to `vault/` and to the other sidecars (`intake-runs.json`) —
//     never committed (SC6). `data/` is gitignored.
//   - `conv_id` is sanitized to a single safe path segment so a hostile
//     adapter can't path-traverse out of `transcripts/` (SC6).
//   - GATE COHERENCE (spec §5 Q-gate, resolved): if the intake gate that
//     would drain the buffer is OFF (`curator.intake.enabled` via
//     isIntakeEnabled), this REFUSES and buffers NOTHING — no raw text at
//     rest for a dead pipeline. The caller/hook is told capture is disabled
//     so it can log it; full sweep-side coherence is T2.
//
// Fail-soft (AGENTS.md): an internal error here returns a clean JSON result,
// never a 500 stack trace that could break an agent's turn.
