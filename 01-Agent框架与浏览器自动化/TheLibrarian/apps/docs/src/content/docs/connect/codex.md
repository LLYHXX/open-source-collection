description: Connect OpenAI Codex to The Librarian — shared memory and handoffs, no plugin code.
---

[Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex) is OpenAI's coding agent. It supports
The Librarian's standard protocol (MCP) directly, so connecting it is **one
configuration block — no plugin, no code**.

**When you'd use this:** you work in Codex and want shared memory and handoffs
alongside your other tools.

**Before you start:** you need a running Librarian server, its **MCP URL**, and an
**agent token** — see [Install](/start-here/install/).

## The easy way

```sh
npx @the-librarian/cli install      # choose Codex; paste your MCP URL + token
npx @the-librarian/cli update       # later: refresh the integration
```

This writes the configuration block for you and installs the automatic-capture
hooks. Capture needs one extra opt-in: see [Automatic capture](#automatic-capture)
below.

## The manual way

Add this to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.librarian]
url = "https://librarian.example.com/mcp"
bearer_token_env_var = "LIBRARIAN_AGENT_TOKEN"
```

The token is referenced by **name** here, never written as a value — Codex sends
it only in the request header. Set it in your shell profile and restart Codex:

```sh
export LIBRARIAN_AGENT_TOKEN="<your-token>"
```

The `/mcp` panel should now list `librarian` with seven tools.

## What you get

- **Seven memory and handoff tools** — recall, remember, flag, store/list/claim
  handoffs, and search references.
- **The primer** — Codex presents The Librarian's briefing as guidance alongside
  the tools, so the recall/remember loop and the handoff protocol ride into every
  session with no setup.
- **Plain-language control** — Codex has no slash commands, so you simply say what
  you want: "hand this off", "pick up where I left off", "save what we learned",
  "go private". The agent maps each to the right action.

## Automatic capture

Codex can capture your conversation automatically, the same way Claude Code does.
The installer wires the hooks, but Codex will not **fire** them until you turn the
feature on — add this to `~/.codex/config.toml` and restart Codex:

```toml
[features]
codex_hooks = true
```

Capture is on by default once enabled, skips [private mode](/guides/private-mode/),
and can be switched off per machine with `LIBRARIAN_AUTO_SAVE=false`.

:::note[Verified transcript handling]
The hook fields and native rollout JSONL parser are verified against Codex 0.144.3.
The adapter captures visible user and assistant prose once, excluding duplicate
records, developer context, reasoning, and tool traffic. If a future Codex version
uses an unknown record or payload variant—or writes a malformed complete record—
capture fails quietly and holds its byte cursor for a compatible update instead of
discarding unread data. Upgrading from 1.4.1 reconstructs private-mode state from
the consumed prefix locally without uploading that prefix. Explicit memory
(telling the agent to remember) works regardless.
:::

## Check it worked

Open Codex's `/mcp` panel; a healthy Librarian lists exactly **seven** tools. If
it does not appear, confirm `LIBRARIAN_AGENT_TOKEN` is set in the shell that
launched Codex.
