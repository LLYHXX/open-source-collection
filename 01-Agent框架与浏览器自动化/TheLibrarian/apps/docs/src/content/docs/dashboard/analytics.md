description: See how big your memory collection is and how much the curator's LLM is being used.
---

The **Analytics** page is a read-only summary of your collection and of how much
work the curator's language model is doing. It is the page to glance at when you
want to know "how much do we know?" and "what is this costing in tokens?".

## What you'll see

- **Totals** — at-a-glance tiles: total memories, recent curator runs, and the
  input and output tokens those runs used.
- **Breakdowns** — your memories split **by agent** (which tool contributed them)
  and **by status** (active, proposed, archived), each shown as a count with a
  proportion bar.
- **Curator LLM usage** — when the curator has run, a summary of total tokens and
  completed runs, broken down **per model** so you can see which model is doing the
  work and roughly what it is using.

The numbers are live; refresh the page for the current figures. There is nothing to
configure here — it is purely a read-out. To change how the curator runs, use
[Settings → Curator](/dashboard/settings/#curator).
