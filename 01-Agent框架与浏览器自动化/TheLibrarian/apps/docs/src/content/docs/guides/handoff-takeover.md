title: Handoff & takeover
description: Stop work in one agent and pick it up cleanly in another.
---

A **handoff** lets you stop a piece of work in one place and resume it elsewhere —
in a fresh session, or in a completely different tool — without re-explaining
everything. One agent writes a structured summary; another reads it back and
carries on. This is what makes The Librarian a *cross-tool* layer rather than just
per-tool memory.

## Handing work off

When you are about to stop, tell your agent to **hand off**. You can use the
`/handoff` command where it exists, or just say "hand this off" or "we're done for
now" — both do the same thing. The agent writes a handoff document with five fixed
sections:

- **Start & intent** — what you set out to do.
- **Journey** — what happened along the way.
- **Current state** — where things stand right now.
- **What's left** — the remaining work.
- **Open questions** — anything undecided.

All five are required — the system refuses a document missing any of them, which is
what keeps handoffs genuinely useful. The agent saves it and returns an id you can
reference later.

## Picking work back up

In the new session or tool, tell the agent to **take over**. Use `/takeover`, or
say "pick up where I left off" or "what was I doing?". The agent lists the handoffs
waiting for the current project, you choose one, and it **claims** it and continues
from where the document leaves off.

Claiming is **one-shot and atomic**: only one agent can claim a given handoff. If
two try at once, the loser is simply told who already has it — so work is never
accidentally picked up twice.

## Reading handoffs yourself

You can read any handoff in the dashboard's [Handoffs](/dashboard/handoffs/) page —
the document and all its details. Note the dashboard is read-only for handoffs:
*claiming* is something agents do, because claiming is part of resuming the work.

## Handoffs vs memories

They are different tools for different jobs:

- A **handoff** describes *in-progress work* and is claimed exactly once. It is
  evidence of where you were, not a permanent fact.
- A **memory** is a *durable fact* you want to keep. To promote something you
  learned during the work into lasting memory, use "save what we learned" (the
  `/learn` flow) instead.

## A note on private mode

If you are in [private mode](/guides/private-mode/), handing off writes to the
server, so the agent will ask you to confirm before it saves anything.
