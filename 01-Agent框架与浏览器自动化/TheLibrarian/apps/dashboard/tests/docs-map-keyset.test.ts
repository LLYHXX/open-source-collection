// Spec 063 — exact key-set pin for the derived docs map.
//
// The existing cross-surface guard (tests/docs-map.test.ts) iterates the CURRENT
// slug set, so a *shrunken* map still passes it — a derivation that dropped, say,
// /activity or /health would go unnoticed. This pin fixes the full 18-key map by
// value, so any missing or extra route is caught.
