// The badge/consequence helper is the D5 mapping made testable in isolation —
// no DOM, no server. It decides what an operator sees on a proposal row: an
// authoritative target-implying badge (Update / Replace / Merge / Split) ONLY
// when the proposal carries resolved targets, and an honest "New — needs
// filing" for an intake submission the curator couldn't place. The Approve
// button's label states the archival consequence when sources will be archived.
