// docker network. So the dashboard's tRPC clients target LIBRARIAN_TRPC_URL (the
// base URL of that internal listener; we append /trpc below) and send NO

// The BARE bootstrap client (spec 065 SC 3 / §4 "two clients"). NO identity headers callback —
// deliberately, twice over:
//
//   1. The circularity: `auth()`'s lazy config resolves through the auth-config fetch; an identity
//      callback CALLS `auth()`. One client with an identity callback would therefore await the very
//      in-flight config promise it is blocking — a circular await that re-arms on every cache
//      expiry, degrading to an abort and a headerless (⇒ machine-trust) request. The bare client
//      breaks the cycle (spec 065 §7 pass 1, blocking).
//   2. The trust model: the flows riding this client ARE machine calls whose credentials are
//      out-of-band — the auth-config fetch (process trust; four sessionless entry points, covered
//      module-wide in auth-config-client.ts), the credentials `verifyPassword` call (its credential
//      IS the password being verified), and the break-glass reset's `redeemSetupLink` (its
//      credential is the single-use, short-TTL, store-validated link token), plus the first-owner
//      `redeemBootstrapClaim` (its credential is the signed, short-TTL provisioner claim). An
//      ABSENT assertion retains today's isolation trust (ADR 0008 P3) exactly so these pre-session
//      flows keep working under a member-aware provider; asserting anonymity here would break
//      sign-in and account recovery in every member-aware deployment (spec 065 §1 / SC 9).
//
// EVERYTHING ELSE rides `serverTRPC` (lib/trpc-server.ts), which asserts identity per request.
// Adding a new bootstrap consumer to this client is a TRUST decision — it speaks with machine
// trust — so don't, unless its credential is genuinely out-of-band like the four above.
