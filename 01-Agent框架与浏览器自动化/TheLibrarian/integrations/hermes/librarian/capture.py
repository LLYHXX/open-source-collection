"""Auto-capture pure transforms (no IO, no network) — Phase 2B / T-Hermes.

The Hermes ``sync_turn`` hook hands the adapter BOTH halves of a completed turn
directly (``user_content`` + ``assistant_content``) plus the stable session id.
That is the §11.2 expectation: the delta is built O(1) from the in-payload turn —
there is NO cursor and NO transcript re-read (unlike the Claude ``Stop`` adapter,
which slices an append-only JSONL file by byte offset).

This module owns the three pure transforms the hook drives, mirroring the Claude
adapter's *guarantees* in Python:

  turn_pair_to_turns   the two halves → ordered [user, assistant] turn dicts
  filter_private_turns forward-only private-span skip (carry-forward across turns)
  build_payload        the uniform /transcript contract body

Everything is fail-soft and trivially unit-testable; the provider (provider.py)
wires the session state, the client ship, and the env gates around these.
