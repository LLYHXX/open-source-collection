// Claude `SessionStart` awareness + capture-status banner — pure builder
// (testable). Spec 2026-06-16-harness-auto-capture, T5 (SC9).
//
// Node stdlib only. This module owns the DETERMINISTIC banner the SessionStart
// hook emits at conversation start (mem0-style). The banner does two things:
//   1. AWARENESS (always): remind the agent it HAS The Librarian — `recall` /
//      `remember` — so the reminder survives a compaction (SessionStart re-fires
//      and the line is re-injected). This is the passive half of D9's recall nudge.
//   2. CAPTURE STATUS: tell the agent whether automatic capture is live, or WARN
//      (naming the reason + the fix) when it is off — either because the server's
//      curator intake gate is disabled, or because LIBRARIAN_AUTO_SAVE=false on
//      this machine (the local kill-switch).
//
// FAIL-SOFT (spec §4.10 / SC9): the status query can fail (server down). When it
// does, the builder STILL emits the static awareness line — no warning (we don't
// know capture is off), no throw. The hook entry never blocks the session.
//
// The builder is PURE over `{ status, env, shipping }` so the impure probes (the
// network /healthz query and the local cursor read) are injected by the hook
// entry and the banner text is unit-testable.
