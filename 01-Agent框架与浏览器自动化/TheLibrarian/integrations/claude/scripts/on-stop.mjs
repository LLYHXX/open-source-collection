// Claude capture hook entry — the THIN shell over the testable pure logic in
// scripts/lib/. Spec 2026-06-16-harness-auto-capture, T3 + PART A.
//
// Wiring (integrations/claude/hooks/hooks.json): the marketplace install (`/plugin
// install`) auto-discovers a plugin's `hooks/hooks.json`; the `UserPromptSubmit`,
// `Stop`, and `SessionEnd` entries ALL run `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/
// on-stop.mjs`. The same entry serves every trigger; `runCapture` is event-agnostic
// (it reads the cursor delta from `transcript_path` and ships it), so no per-event
// branching is needed beyond `isSessionEnd()`.
//
//   - `UserPromptSubmit` is the PRIMARY trigger: it fires just before the assistant
//     reply, so it ingests up to the PREVIOUS completed turn (one turn behind; per
//     spec §8.2 that is fine — incremental ingestion loses at most the last un-acked
//     turn, and the next prompt catches it up). Its payload carries the same
//     `session_id` + `transcript_path` + `cwd` a `Stop` would.
//   - `Stop` / `SessionEnd` are SUPPLEMENTARY belt-and-suspenders; the cursor's
//     advance-on-ack makes multiple firing events idempotent (a re-read delta the
//     server/curator dedup). `SessionEnd` is additionally the explicit-end
//     accelerator — `runCapture`'s `isSessionEnd()` reads `hook_event_name` to set
//     `ended:true` so the server settle-sweep extracts immediately instead of waiting
//     out the idle window (spec §4.4). `UserPromptSubmit` and `Stop` never set `ended`.
//
//   HISTORY (do not regress): this adapter once drove capture from `Stop` only, then
//   switched to `UserPromptSubmit` over Claude Code bug #29767 (plugin-scoped `Stop`
//   hooks registering but not firing). As of Claude Code 2.1.179 — verified 2026-06-17
//   with an isolated single-purpose probe plugin — plugin-scoped `UserPromptSubmit`
//   AND `Stop` BOTH fire reliably. So wiring all three is sound redundancy, NOT a
//   #29767 workaround; do not "simplify" to a single event on the assumption the
//   others don't fire — they do. (The capture failure that looked like a non-firing
//   hook was actually a data-dir mismatch: live hooks write under `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA`
//   — see resolveDataDir in lib/capture.mjs and the SessionStart shipping probe.)
//
// KNOWN TRADEOFF (deferred optimization): the ship is SYNCHRONOUS, so a slow or
// unreachable server adds latency to the user's prompt up to the hook timeout (15s
// for `UserPromptSubmit`) before failing soft. This is bounded and fail-soft — the
// turn always proceeds — but backgrounding the ship (fire-and-forget) so the prompt
// never waits is a deferred optimization, not yet done.
//
// Claude delivers the hook JSON on STDIN (`transcript_path`, `session_id`, `cwd`,
// `hook_event_name`, and `agent_id` for a subagent Stop). We read it, hand it to
// `runCapture`, and ALWAYS `exit 0`.
//
// FAIL-SOFT CONTRACT (AGENTS.md / SC10): this process must never block the user's
// turn, never exit non-zero in a way that breaks Claude, never leak a stack trace
// to stdout/stderr that reaches the model. So: no output on the happy path, errors
// go to the local sidecar (capture.log) only, and we exit 0 unconditionally —
// even on a parse failure or an unhandled rejection. On uncertainty, do nothing.

/**
 * Read all of stdin (the hook JSON) as a string. Resolves "" if there is none.
 *
 * FAIL-SOFT / NO-HANG (I2): fail-soft must never depend on the harness closing
 * the pipe. A held-open stdin (no `end` event) would otherwise hang this process
 * until the harness's own timeout. We resolve on `end`/`error` as normal, but ALSO
 * arm a short internal timeout that resolves with whatever we have so far (usually
 * `""`) so the entry can fail-soft no-op and exit promptly instead of stalling the
 * user's turn.
